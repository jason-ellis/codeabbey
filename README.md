# codeabbey

These are my solutions for codeabbey.com. If you've never used CodeAbbey, I recommend you check it out. It's like Project Euler, but focuses on general problem-solving instead of only math.

I'm hosting these solutions on GitHub because I like making my code available. Please don't use them to cheat on CodeAbbey.

My current weapon of choice is Python 3. If I solve these problems in another language, I'll be sure to include that as well.

Thank you to Rodion Gorkovenko for his work on CodeAbbey.
